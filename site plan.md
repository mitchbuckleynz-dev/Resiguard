FAQ Section
Headline: "Common Questions From Smart Rural Builders"
Accordion-style FAQ items:
Mobile: Full-width accordions, large tap targets, smooth animations
Closed state: Show question with down arrow icon (right-aligned)
Open state: Expand to show answer, flip arrow up
Q: "Will sprinklers damage my home if they go off accidentally?"
A: Modern systems use individual head activation - only the sprinkler near the fire activates, using minimal water. False activations are extremely rare (less than 1 in 16 million per year per head).
Q: "What about ongoing maintenance?"
A: Annual inspection costs $150-250. Compare that to maintaining and replacing multiple 35,000L tank systems.
Q: "Do all NZ councils accept this?"
A: Yes - it's in the NZ Building Code (C/AS7). We handle all council liaison and documentation.
Q: "Can I add this to my existing build plans?"
A: Absolutely! The earlier we're involved, the easier and cheaper the integration. But we can work with any stage.
Q: "What if I'm on a tight budget?"
A: This typically SAVES money overall. Plus financing options available.
